# The-Hottest-Topics-in-Machine-Learning
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work 
is published. In this Project, we will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest
trends in machine learning.
